<h1>The Jester</h1>
<i>Act suspicious to get eliminated by a vigilante</i>
<p></p>
<p>The Jester's objective in a match is to get killed by the innocents, usually by getting a Vigilante to be suspicious of you. <b>This is your only win condition.</b></p>
<p>To help you act suspicious, the Jester is given a few tools.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Jester Instinct:</b> Use the Killer Instinct keybind to see dead bodies through walls.</li>
  <li><b>Silly Goofy Mood:</b> Your mood level doesnt cause hallucinations or hide bodies.</li>
  <li><b>Lockpick:</b> You're given a lockpick to open any door, however this drains your mood. If your mood is too low, you will no longer be able to pick locks until you complete a task.</li>
</ul>
